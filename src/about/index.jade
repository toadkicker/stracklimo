            h1.text-center A Word from Matthew Strack
            h3.gray.text-center(style="padding-bottom:3rem") CEO of Strack Ground Transportation
            h3.gray.text-center Idea.
            p.lead.gray People often ask how I got involved in the luxury transportation industry. And, in truth, I say it was by accident! In 2005, I was working ceaselessly to support a new business venture and decided to start driving limousines to help supplement income. Shortly after I began driving, the owner offered the chance for me to buy the company. A limousine company was the last thing I wanted to own but I made an offer.

            p.lead.gray And with this unlikely story, Strack Chauffeured Transportation was formed. Starting out, I spent a lot of time watching our competitors; analyzing what they were doing right and where they fell short. I quickly realized the opportunity to establish a niche in the market by offering a consistently reliable, premium level of service. Utilizing my experience in business development and knowledge of financial services, I constructed a progressive, client-focused model of luxury transportation.
